	abstract = {We investigate the dependence of stellar population properties of galaxies on group dynamical stage for a subsample of the Yang catalog. We classify groups according to their galaxy velocity distribution into Gaussian (G) and Non-Gaussian (NG). Using two totally independent approaches, we have shown that our measurement of Gaussianity is robust and reliable. Our sample covers Yang’s groups in the redshift range 0.03 z 0.1, with mass . The new method, called Hellinger Distance, to determine whether a group has a velocity distribution Gaussian or NG is very effective in distinguishing between the two families. NG groups present halo masses higher than the G ones, confirming previous findings. Examining the skewness and kurtosis of the velocity distribution of G and NG groups, we find that faint galaxies in NG groups are mainly infalling, for the first time, into the groups. We show that considering only faint galaxies in the outskirts; those in NG groups are older and more metal-rich than those in G groups. Also, examining the Projected Phase Space of cluster galaxies, we see that bright and faint galactic systems in G groups are in dynamical equilibrium—which does not seem to be the case in NG groups. These findings suggest that NG systems have a higher infall rate, assembling more galaxies that have experienced preprocessing before entering the group.}

    abstract = "{We present results on the study of the stellar population in early-type galaxies (ETGs) belonging to 151 compact groups (CGs). We also selected a field sample composed of 846 ETGs to investigate environmental effects on galaxy evolution. We find that the dependences of mean stellar ages, [Z/H] and [α/Fe] on central stellar velocity dispersion are similar, regardless where the ETG resides, CGs or field. When compared to the sample of centrals and satellites from the literature, we find that ETGs in CGs behave similarly to centrals, especially those embedded in low-mass haloes (\\$M\_\\{\\mathrm\\{ h\\}\\} \\lt 10^ \\{12.5\\}\\, \\mathrm\\{M\\}\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$). Except for the low-mass limit, where field galaxies present a star-forming signature, not seen in CGs, the ionization agent of the gas in CG and field galaxies seem to be similar due to hot, evolved low-mass stars. However, field ETGs present an excess of H α emission relative to ETGs in CGs. Additionally, we performed a dynamical analysis, which shows that CGs present a bimodality in the group velocity dispersion distribution – a high- and low-σ mode. Our results indicate that high-σ groups have a smaller fraction of spirals, shorter crossing times, and a more luminous population of galaxies than the low-σ groups. It is important to emphasize that our findings point to a small environmental impact on galaxies located in CGs. The only evidence we find is the change in gas content, suggesting environmentally driven gas loss.}",

abstract="The new programmable graphical processor units (GPUs) are now often used as high parallel mathematical co-processors, allowing many computational-intensive problems to be executed in less time. It became common and convenient to use single GPUs to implement different kinds of simulations, or to group them in a grid, so the computational power can be highly increased, while the power consumption and physical space increase are significantly lower. The N-body simulation has been successfully ported to the GPUs. This algorithm is typically applied to gravitational simulations, among many other physical problems. In cosmology, one alternative approach seeks to explain the nature of dark matter as a direct result of the non-linear space-time curvature, due to different types of deformation potentials. In order to develop a detailed study of this new approach, our group is developing the COsmic LAgrangian TUrbulence Simulator (COLATUS{\_}ENVIU). The simulator uses the direct particle-particle method to calculate the forces between the particles, so we eliminate the errors included on the hierarchical strategies. It gave robust initial results, but was limited to systems with a small amount of particles. However one limitation on the use of GPUs on N-body simulation to study the details on the mass distribution, is that these systems must have millions (or even billions) of particles, making the use of particle-particle method in one GPU unfeasible due to memory or time computational constraints. In this present work we propose a novel and efficient subdivision method to allow the workload division, allowing a single GPU to be able to solve large simulations, while allowing to watch over a particle during all the simulation.",
